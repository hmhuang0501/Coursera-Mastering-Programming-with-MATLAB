### Overview
This course is the second part of the specialization [MATLAB Programming for Engineers and Scientists Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/matlab-programming-engineers-scientists), offered by Vanderbilt University.
It covers more advanced MATLAB programming concepts such as **recursion**, **vectorization**, **function handles**, **algorithm complexity and efficiency**, **error handling**, etc..
It also presents many powerful features of MATLAB including **object-oriented programming**, **graphical user interface design environment (App Designer)** and **Live Scripts**.

### Final Project

In the final project of this course, I used object-oriented programming techniques and developed a MATLAB application with professional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that visualize COVID-19 pandemic data from around the world.
I did enjoy doing this project as it's a good chance to apply newly learned skills to a real world problem. :)
The data obtained from the [Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) is available from the `covid_data.mat` file. (currently including data up till January 30th, 2021)

#### Features
- Axes for displaying plots
- A list box for countries
- A list box for states/regions
- A widget to select what data (Cases, Deaths or Both) to plot
- A widget to display the option for cumulative or daily data
- A widget to set the number of days for the moving average of the data (from 1 to 15)
- A search box to find a specified country/state/region, so that the user does not have to scroll and find countries/states/regions manually in the list box
- A button to clear the entered text and change to the default settings
- A button to reset everything to the default settings
- Date pickers to change the range of dates to plot
- A toolbar for different functionalities

#### How to run the program?
- If you have MATLAB installed, open MATLAB and run the file `MyCovid19App.mlapp`
- If you do not have MATLAB installed and use Windows on your machine, run the standalone executable `MyCovid19App.exe`
